# awfuldl

This is my first rust project so don't expect anything from it...

## Usage
You should build the app with `cargo` and run it with `cargo run "search"` (for the dev version) or build it with `cargo build`


If you don't have cargo installed you can try running it with : 
`./awfuldl "search"`

if after selecting anime you only have : 
```
starting client and identifying
``` 
and not :
```
starting client and identifying
starting streaming
streaming
```


you'll need to restart the app
### Command
`<ESC> = <quit> <space> = <toggle> <z/s> = <Up/Down> <MAJ+z/MAJ+s> = <Select + Up/Select + Down> <CTRL+z/CTRL+s> = <Unselect + Up/Unselect + Down>`
