# awfuldl

This is my first rust project so don't expect anything from it...

## Usage

`./awfuldl "search"`

if after selecting anime you only have : 
```
starting client and identifying
``` 
and not :
```
starting client and identifying
starting streaming
streaming
```


you'll need to restart the app
